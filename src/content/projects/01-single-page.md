**Due: October 6**

For our first project, we will be making a single-page website about a topic of your choice.
It should include the following:

- A header with a navigation menu (anchor links)
- At least three sections of content (e.g., About, Services, Contact)
- A footer

It should work on both desktop and mobile devices, using a mobile-first design approach.

You will be graded on the following criteria: (rubric to come)

- Visual Design
- Use of Semantic HTML
- Responsiveness
- Accessibility

Some potential topics:

- An 'about me' page for a friend (like Linktree but with a bit more info)
- An event page for a local event
- A page for a local business/restaurant
- A website for a friend's band or creative project
