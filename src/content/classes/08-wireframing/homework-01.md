## Wireframing for Project 1

Create mobile and desktop wireframes for your Project 1 website.
Remember, we don't need to worry about colors, fonts, or images at this stage - just focus on layout and structure. We also shouldn't be using _specific_ content yet, just placeholder text (like "Lorem ipsum") and images (like gray boxes). It's ok to use real content for headings.

You can use any wireframing tool you like - Balsamiq, Figma, Miro, or even pen and paper (just take a photo and upload it).
