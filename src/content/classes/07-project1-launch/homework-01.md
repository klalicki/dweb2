## Planning Content/Layout for Project 1.

Let's plan out the content and layout for your single page site project. I would suggest starting with a Google Doc and writing out your text content. Remember to use headings and subheadings to organize your content. You can also include links to images/other media you plan to use.

Once you have your content written, you can start thinking about layout. We're going to stick to rough low-fi wireframes for this project - I would recommend sketching them on paper. Think about areas where you might want to use components - any place that you plan to use the same design element more than once.
