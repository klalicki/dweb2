## Planning Content/Layout for Project 1.

Let's plan out the content and layout for your single page site project. I would suggest starting with a Google Doc and writing out your text content. Remember to use headings and subheadings to organize your content. You can also include links to images/other media you plan to use.

Add a link to your Google Doc to your Project 1 Proposal page on your site.
