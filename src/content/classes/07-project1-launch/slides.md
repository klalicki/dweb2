# Let's Review the Homework

Any parts that were challenging? Let's go through them.

# Components

One of the core concepts of the modern web is the idea of components.

_Components_ are reusable elements that can be used throughout a website/app.

---

## Why Components?

- Reusability: design/build once, use many times
- Consistency: same look/feel across the entire site
- Maintainability: update in one place, changes everywhere
- Efficiency: less work!

DRY principle: Don't Repeat Yourself
