# Homework: CSS Practice

For this homework, you'll be building out a webpage using CSS. All of the HTML is provided for you. You shouldn't need to add or change any HTML, just the CSS.

_Edit 9/10: Don't worry if you don't finish the whole thing; this is a complex assignment. Do as much as you can, and we will look at it together in class Thursday._

## Instructions:

Here is the Figma design you'll be replicating:

https://www.figma.com/design/lWGzw4TGO77dld4zTJYUAM/Untitled?node-id=0-1&t=AkbVMJXXggmDeagb-1

You'll be working on this in Astro on your personal site folder. The HTML for this will already be loaded into 'assignment 1'

Reminder - when you're in the Astro codespace, you will need to open the terminal (probably on the panel at the bottom of the screen) and run `npm run dev` to start the local server. You will then be provided with a link to open the site (which you can also find in the 'Ports' tab near the terminal)
