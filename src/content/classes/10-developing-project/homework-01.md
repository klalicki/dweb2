## Make some progress on Project 1.

Try to at least get components set up (even if you don't fully style them).
This project will theoretically be due 10/6, but we'll see how things go.

Come to class with questions on Thursday. We'll be doing project work in class and I'll do mini lessons on whatever you need.
