## Introductions

Name, pronouns, major, year, and something fun you did this summer.

---

## What is the goal of this class?

---

## 1

For you to be comfortable designing & building multi-page websites.

## 2

For you to be able to design a website and deliver your design to another developer so they can understand it without _asking a million questions._

---

If you want to 'do a website' for your thesis, this class will help you learn the tools you need to make it happen.

## Course Logistics

### Class Structure

We will start most days with a lesson. We'll do a mix of 'lecture' and hands-on activities.

We will often have a homework assignment, in which you apply the skills you learned in class.

At the end of class, we will usually have work time - this is a great time to work on your project and ask me/your peers for feedback.

---

We will use this site https://dweb2.netlify.app to keep track of lessons, assignments & projects.

We will set up personal websites next week for your individual assignments and in-progress work.

Finished project submissions will go in The Jar.
