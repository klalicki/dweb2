We're going to need to set up some (free) accounts on various platforms to use this semester.

### Figma

We'll be using Figma as our main design tool. You should be able to sign up as a student to get a free education account. If you took Shauna's Design for the Web class recently, you should have this already. Here's the link to Figma Education:

Once you have your education account set up, you should be able to join my Figma Team:

### GitHub

We will be using GitHub to store our code, as well as for its online editing environment (GitHub Codespaces). As a student you're eligible for a GitHub for Students account, which gives you a free Pro subscription plus access to a bunch of other software and learning resources.

### Netlify

We'll be using Netlify to build and deploy our projects so we can share them with each other and the WORLD. Netlify has a very generous free tier that will be sufficient for what we're doing this semester.

### Codecademy

Codecademy is a great learning resource that offers interactive lessons - they will provide a lesson and a little code editing environment for you to practice what you learned. I'll be assigning modules from this as needed throughout the semester. I will only assign files from free courses, so no need to pay for a subscription.
