- Reviewing Project Process
- Catch up on everything

We didn't really cover much new material today. For Monday, please try to catch up on Project 1 so we can dive into actually building our projects. You should have the following complete and posted to your site:

1. Project concept (1-2 sentences)
2. Draft of complete website content, as well as any media/images you plan to use.
3. Mobile and Desktop Wireframes.
  - The main goal of these is to get a _rough_ idea of how content is laid out and how that layout changes from mobile to desktop.
  - You don't need to include "real" content; the 'scribble' tool in Balsamiq is great for this.
  - If you are designing a section of your site that will have a lot of repeated layout elements (ie 10 components that use the same structure/layout) you can just lay out a few of them to get a feel for how they appear together.
4. Style Tile (3 variations)- we talked about these briefly in class on 9/25. The general premise is that you should be exploring the visual look of your site. See below 'homework' for the full list of what is needed for these.
