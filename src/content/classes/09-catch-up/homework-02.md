Let's practice writing in Markdown!

I want you to create a Markdown file somewhere in your personal site folder (maybe in a new folder called `text` or `markdown` or something like that).

In that file, use Markdown to write your site content for your Project 1 site. Make sure to use headings (`#`, `##`, etc.), paragraphs, etc.

Then, import that Markdown file into your Project 1 proposal page.
